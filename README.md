# Textual Linux System Tray Apps

I generally prefer informative textual System Tray (Task Bar / Notification Area) apps over less-informative graphical ones.  However, due to limitations in the common graphics libraries, textual apps are extremely hard to find, so I have written a few of my own.  All of these apps use the GtkTrayIcon library (provided in the [gtktrayicon](gtktrayicon) subdirectory).  I use these with [Trayer](https://github.com/sargon/trayer-srg), but they should work with Gnome, KDE, Enlightenment, or any other window manager with support for the freedesktop.org System Tray Protocol Specification.

See the comments at the top of each app's script for setup and configuration.

Inspiration for these apps came from [http://code.google.com/p/gtk-tray-utils/](http://code.google.com/p/gtk-tray-utils/).
